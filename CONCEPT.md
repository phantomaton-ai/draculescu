# Draculescu

Draculescu is a generative retelling of Bram Stoker's Dracula.

## Naming

Draculescu is a semi-modernization of the name Dracula; see [naming](./NAMING.md).

## Themes

Draculescu is set in the late 1800s to leverage parallels with the modern zeitgeist.

### Industrialization anxiety

Draculescu embodies the intrusion of "old world" thinking upon modern constructed reality.

On some level, this is just the old tension between civilization and wilderness: Tiamat and Marduk.

On a more specific level, we wish to mirror the automation anxieties of the early twenty-first century with industrialization anxieties of the late nineteenth.

The vampire Draculescu, in this context, represents the failure of the question "industrialize or not?" to address the threats neither caused nor solved by industrialization.

### Themed lands

The protagonists live on The Island and the antagonist arrives from deep in The Mainland; these are ambiguously England and mainland Europe, but is never explicitly referred to as such.

#### The Island

The Island is a metaphor for civilization; or, more specifically, for the spaces in which a person may safely feel as if they have been insulated from nature, wildness, and unpredictability in the socially external sense. (On The Island, there is chaos, but it is only ever expected or seen as normal when it is manufactured socially, e.g. war.)

The Island is also specifically focused toward the notion of industrial civilization, or of civilization as an industrialization process. Thematically we tend to conflate in this story the ideas of productive optimization and the naming of these things; that is, we look at the emergence of language and the structures of law as industrializing influences, as they provided a capacity for measurement which allowed humans to employ strategies to optimize production. 

#### The Mainland

The Mainland is a metaphor for nature, or wildness, or deeper reality, or fundamental truths; pre-civilized, primitive thinking, superstition, religion.

### Morality

The morality of Draculescu is ambiguous.

On the one hand, Draculescu may be seen as a monstrous antagonist who threatens and preys upon desperate naive protagonists.

On the other hand, Draculescu may be seen as a relatable, sympathetic protagonist who simply wants to eat, and yet is daunted by his food, the antagonists.

The narrative should proceed in a fashion which simultaneously propels both narratives forward in parallel.

#### Mob mentality

In one interpretation of the story, Draculescu is a perfectly well-intentioned practitioner of some lost healing art who tries and fails to save both The Wealthy Woman and The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife from the plague. His relationships with his deformed dog and The Vagrant reflect a silently non-superficial, non-judgmental, non-classist nature; The Vampire Hunter and his team cruelly treat the unsightliness of Draculescu's companions as evidence of rotten affinities. Similarly, The Vampire Hunter et al attribute multiple deaths not to the plague, but to Draculescu, becoming animated toward violence toward a strange man who tried sincerely to aid them.

#### Instinctual trust

In another interpretation of the story, Draculescu is indeed a genuine vampire, pretending to be a well-intentioned plague doctor in order to gain access to potential victims, then uses the excuse of the plague to avoid suspicion for their deaths. The Vampire Hunter and his team wisely discern Draculescu's true nature, carefully piecing together of "off" feelings until a clear image of Draculescu's vampiric nature emerges. Strange animals sightings must mean that Draculescu can transform; a sudden cluster of deaths during the plague must mean that another vampire remains present; and so on.

## Characters

Draculescu is told through the use of a small set of characters.

### Draculescu

## Locations

Most locations have one interior and one exterior; some, such as The Ship and The Manor, have multiple interiors.

### The Ship

### The Port

### The Forest

A dark, grim forest on The Mainland; isolates the road to The Castle.

### The Castle

Castle Drăculești. On a hilltop. Uninhabited, except for Mister Draculescu and Draculescu's Dog.

## Plot

Draculescu arrives on The Island to aid a sick wealthy woman during a plague.

## Structure

Three acts, plus a prologue and an epilogue.

### Prologue

Under five minutes. Set in The Mainland. The courier arrives at Castle Drăculești to summon Mister Draculescu to The Island. The courier has a strange dinner with Mister Draculescu to discuss the letter.

### Act one

Draculescu arrives at The Island is ushered in with significant anticipation. His interactions at this stage are ominous. The Vagrant becomes enthralled to Draculescu. The Wealthy Woman dies at the end of this first act. Draculescu disappears.

### Act two

A series of mysterious deaths occur. The Vampire Hunter arrives to attribute these deaths to The Wealthy Woman becoming a vampire. The Lighthouse Keeper reveals he secretly sought out Draculescu to aid his plague-stricken wife, as well, and now fears she will become a vampire. The Wealthy Woman's Husband seeks revenge on The Courier, whom he blames for finding Draculescu; their confrontation nearly becomes fatal for The Courier until the intercession of The Vampire Hunter, who organizes a team to hunt Draculescu in an effort to save The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife.

### Act three

A team consisting of The Vampire Hunter, The Lighthouse Keeper, The Wealthy Woman's Husband, The Doctor, The Courier (who is coerced), and The Vagrant (who has been captured) travel to The Mainland to hunt Draculescu at The Castle.

### Epilogue

Some kind of dramatic reveal; for example, we may find out that some unexpected character from earlier has become a vampire (if so, there should be some subtle foreshadowing woven in earlier).

## Style

We wish to tell an animated story in the style of Egon Schiele, resembling a living painting. We pair this with music inspired by Arnold Schoenberg.

### Characterization

To enable visual and musical storytelling, we will want every character to have:

* A succinct summary of their physical appearance, with focus on distinguishing characteristics and outfits. The purpose is to enable consistent character generation (sufficient to track which characters are which from shot to shot) 
* A distinguishing instrument for use in the score; the set of characters in each scene determines the set of instruments in the background.

## Format

To enable multimodal generation, we employ a text-frst fill-in-the-blanks approach built around the following file structure:

* `script/outline.md`: High-level summary, with links to individual acts.
* `script/acts/<i-iii>.md`: Detailed description of plot progression for Act I (or II, or III) with ordered links to individual scenes.
* `script/acts/<i-iii>/scenes/<name>.md`: 
* `script/acts/<i-iii>/scenes/<name>/shots/<name>.shot.md`

We want 330-600 shots total, or 110-200 shots per act. Consequently, we'll want roughly a dozen scenes per act, and roughly a dozen shots per scene.

Each shot consists of:

* A prompt for generating an initial image in the scene.
* A prompt for generating a video from that image (describing camera movement, actions, etc); note that this will be silent.
* An optional caption (which should appear in quotes if it is spoken by a character) which will be displayed briefly after the corresponding video segment.
* A summary of the music which will play during that shot.

For purposes of timing, we assume that each shot is 8 seconds in length, 

### Interpretation

Beginning at `outline.md`, we follow Markdown links to intepret scts/scenes/shots in order.

For every `.shot.md` file, we will first generate an image and then a video based on its descriptions.

If a caption is present, a still image of the caption will be generated as well.

Finally, the resulting videos and captions will be concatenated in-order, and music will be overlaid to produce the finished product.

### Shot template

To enable consistent parsing via conventional software, each `.shot.md` file should look like:

```
# <Shot name>

<Optional description; not used in rendering>

![<Image generation prompt.>](./<shot-name>.png)

[<Video generation prompt.>](./<shot-name>.mp4)

![<<Text of caption, quoted if spoken by a character>.>](./<shot-name>.caption.png)
```
