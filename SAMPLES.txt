Steampunk messy vignette painting in the style of Egon Schiele; gouache and watercolor on paper, painted 1911. The style is Austrian expressionism, with exaggerated poses and angles, energetic 
brushwork, and a heavy use of sfumato. The execution is painterly and modestly abstract, with rough line work and ambiguous edges. The image has an unfinished quality, with exposed paper showing 
through. Regions of color take on interesting internal geometries, like little gems, often desaturated and earthy, but occasionally popping through with unexpectedly bright and vivid tones.

A gaunt man with a large, completely bald head, deathly pale skin with faint blue veins, a pointed chin, a tall narrow nose, and shiny circular spectacles, wearing a large black collarless overcoat. 
The subject stands at the foot of a 19th century hospital bed, looking down solemnly at an anonymous female patient.

The figure is seen in profile in a full-body wide shot.

gaunt man wears a plague doctor's mask, a black narrow-brimmed high-capped round-topped capotain hat decorated with a raven's feather held in place by a gold demonic dragon insignia, and a large 
black collarless overcoat. He stands stoically, upright, on the wooden deck of a large masted ship, with ropes and masts visible in the background. The sky is darkened by clouds; rain falls. The 
figure's face is completely obscured by a brown leather hood attached to the mask.

The figure is seen in profile, facing right.

A lighthouse sits upon a rocky outcropping, its beam illuminating the fog around it. Beyond it, a masted ship appears upon the gloomy horizon. The dark sea sprays tepidly against the rocks.

Seen in a long shot, with the lighthouse on the left of the image, with the ship small in the distance to the right.
